# ip-network-labs Cisco IP Networking Labs – VLANs, Switch Security & ASA Firewall (CLI)

Labs on VLANs, Switch Security,ip subnetting and ASA Firewall Configuration (Cisco CLI)

Welcome to my networking lab portfolio! This repository contains two detailed, hands-on labs that demonstrate my practical skills in configuring Cisco network infrastructure using the **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**. These labs are designed to simulate **real-world enterprise network environments** with focus on **network segmentation, security, and edge firewall configuration** using Cisco ASA.

##  Labs Included

###  Week 4 – VLANs & Secure Switch Configuration

**Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
**Focus Areas:**
- VLAN creation and trunking (`VLAN 10`, `VLAN 333`, `VLAN 999`)
- Switch security features (Port Security, BPDU Guard, PortFast)
- DHCP snooping setup
- Securing unused ports
- Configuring and verifying switchport behavior

**Key Outcomes:**
- Reduced attack surface via port lockdown and DHCP snooping
- Proper segmentation using VLANs and trunk configuration
- Prevented STP attacks with BPDU guard

###  Week 5 – Cisco ASA Firewall Configuration Using CLI

**Tools Used:** Cisco ASA CLI (via Packet Tracer)  
**Focus Areas:**
- Basic ASA configuration (hostname, domain, security levels)
- Inside, outside, and DMZ interface setup
- Static NAT and Dynamic NAT via network objects
- DHCP configuration and local AAA authentication
- SSH access from inside and outside network
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for DMZ web server access

**Key Outcomes:**
- Successfully configured a secure ASA edge firewall
- Enabled remote and local admin access using SSH and AAA
- Segregated traffic and protected internal hosts using NAT & ACLs
